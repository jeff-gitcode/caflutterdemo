## Flutter

- Flutter is Cross-Platform.
- Flutter is a UI toolkit and SDK which you can use to build applications. Flutter is open source and you can use it to build highly performant mobile and desktop apps.

## State Management

BLOC/Cubit

![alt text](./doc/bloc-cubit.webp)

- The best way to keep your code organized, clean, and maintainable in Flutter is to have a component that can mediate what the user sees and its logic. This component is Bloc (Business Logic Component.)

- The Cubit is a subset of the famous implementation of BLoC Pattern: bloclibrary.dev, it abandons the concept of Events and simplifies the way of emitting states. A Cubit is just a class that extends (inherits) from BlocBase, and due to its definition, it always requires an initial state. If we donâ€™t specify the state type, the state is assumed automatically to be of type dynamic.
